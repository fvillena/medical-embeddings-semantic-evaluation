## Medical Word Embeddings Semantic Evaluation
Here we release test sets to assess the semantic performance of your medical word embeddings. All of this release is based on @zwChan work.

We are releasing the Medical Analogy Test Set in Spanish language as well as SNOMED concepId and we are waiting for pull requests from another languages!.

With the SNOMED release of your language you can map the concepId to their description.
