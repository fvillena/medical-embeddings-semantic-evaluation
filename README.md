## Medical Word Embeddings Semantic Evaluation
Here we releasing test sets to assess the semantic performance of your medical word embeddings. We translated the terms to SNOMED `conceptId` of @[zwChan](https://github.com/zwChan)'s work.

We release the Medical Analogy Test Set in Spanish language as well as in SNOMED `concepId` and we are waiting for pull requests from another languages!.

With the SNOMED release of your language you can map the `concepId` to their description.
